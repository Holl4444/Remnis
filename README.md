#### The Process
I had originally planned to put this project together with Node.js but transferred it over to Next.js when, having a better idea of the code it seemed the best fit for the project. The drawback being that the commits for the very early stages are in the old repo, so if you're interested you can see the project taking shape here: https://github.com/Holl4444/RemnisReact. This allowed me to try out NextRequest and NextResponse and I was really pleased with how smooth they were to use. 
I started from the form element, thinking of the most basic MVP as more of an online journal and had some fun looking into the changes to forms in React-19. Having spent a considerable amount of time reading up on possible APIs I could use for Speech to text and getting very little done, I got some extremely valuable advice to the effect of the best way to find
the answers is to try them out. I am currently using OpenAI's whisper API with the cheapest model v1. So far the accuracy is very good straight from the box, though thanks to the current heatwave and a loud fan the very first transcription read "Octopresses" instead of "Hot off the presses".
